# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Killer Feature 1: 
#      Recommended friends.
#      We would go through all of a user's friends'
#      friends and count up how many of them are recurring throughout and 
#      has a relatively high friendship leve. 
#      If the friend that popped up the most is not friends with the user, 
#      it will be a recommended friend. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Killer Feature 2: 
#      We calculate a "top chart", where we take into consideration 
#      both the amount of friends and the "quality" of friends. Meaning that this
#      feature would output the list of all users ranked from top to bottom. We 
#      Calculate their "score" by averiging out their overall level of friendship
#      and muiltiply it their number of friends. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Best Friend Chain Algorithm
#       In  order to solve this we will use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
